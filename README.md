# Evacuteer

Welcome to the [Evacuteer](http://www.evacuteer.org) project. Evacuteer is a non-profit specializing in community-assisted evacuations of the New Orleans area.

Evacuteer works year-round to recruit and train volunteers to assist multiple governmental agencies in the event of a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans.

# This Project

The current tech stack for Evacuteer consists of a [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org) instance and a lot of manual labor synchronizing spreadsheets, text messages, and other documents. The Evacuteer project exists to introduce more integrated technology to both the fair-weather and evacuation-time practices at Evacuteer.
