# Evacuteer

Welcome to the [Evacuteer](http://www.evacuteer.org) project. Evacuteer is a non-profit specializing in community-assisted evacuations of the New Orleans area.

Evacuteer works year-round to recruit and train volunteers to assist multiple governmental agencies in the event of a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans.

# This Project

The current tech stack for Evacuteer consists of a [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org) instance and a lot of manual labor synchronizing spreadsheets, text messages, and other documents. The Evacuteer project exists to introduce more integrated technology to both the fair-weather and evacuation-time practices at Evacuteer.

The project was initially started as a project to get computer science students from [Dillard University](http://dillard.edu) hands-on experience designing and developing large software projects while also allowing them to contribute back to their communities.

The long-term vision is to provide Evacuteer and the citizens of New Orleans a technical solution for evacuation preparedness and execution.

In practice, this means that we will support the staff of Evacuteer by:

* Synchronizing with their existing CiviCRM database perpetually or until the CivicCRM instance is no longer necessary
* Proving a platform for tracking volunteer preferences, education timelines, and other data necessary to ensure that a well-prepared set of volunteers is able to be dispatched as-needed to Evacuspots across the New Orleans metro.
* Providing a platform for Evacuteer staff to communicate with volunteers in the case of an emergency
* Providing a platform for Evacuteer staff to communicate with the public in the case of an emergency

We will support the Evacuteer volunteers by:

* Providing a platform where volunteers can keep their contact information and preferences up to date
* Providing a platform where volunteers can know what is needed of them in the case of an emergency or in the case of quiet-time training

We will also provide support to New Orleans residents and visitors by:

* Providing a platform for the public to understand the evacuation process and to know where to go and when to be evacuated
